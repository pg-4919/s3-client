## Installation ##

1. Install Fabric 1.19 on your computer. A good tutorial for Windows can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:install_mcl:windows).
2. Find and click the green "Code" button on the top right of this page.
3. Click "Download as ZIP."
4. Find the "s3-client.zip" file in your downloads folder. Copy that file using Ctrl+C.
5. Find your game folder.
  1. If you optionally followed Step 2 on the Fabric Installation Guide, navigate to the custom game directory you specified.
  2. If you didn't, press the Windows key and the letter R at the same time. In the box that comes up, type "%appdata%\.minecraft." (Without quotes.)
6. Inside this game folder, you should see a "mods" folder. Open that.
7. Paste "s3-client.zip" into the mods folder.
8. Right click the zip file and choose "Extract All." You should get a folder named "s3-client." If you still have the zip file, you can delete it now.
9. Move all the .jar files from "s3-client" into "mods."
10. Delete the "s3-client" file.
11. Start up Minecraft using your Fabric profile. It'll be slow on the first time due to DashLoader.
